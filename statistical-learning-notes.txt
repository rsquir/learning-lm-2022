p. 14

continuous or quantatative data
regression (big ?)
catagorical or qualitative data

qualitative data: gender, religion, marital status
	type
quantative data: age, height, weight, income
	numerical value
catagorical data: catagory
continuous data: numerical value

continuous or quantatative data regression
categorical or qualitative predict non-numerical value


p.20

n represents # of distinc data points
p denote # of variables that are available for making predictions

	Wage data set contains 11 vars for 3000 ppl, so n = 3000 and p = 11

i = 1, 2, ...n
j = 1, 2, ...p
xij matrix with bounds n and p

xT, T denotes the transpose of the matrix/vector

censored: not fully observed


p. 26 Beggining of 1st Chapter

Y = predictors, independent variables, features, or sometimes just variable


p. 28 Why estimate f?

reason to predict, prediction and inference

f^ is estimate for f, and Y^ is prediction for Y

reducible error and irreducible error

inference “to what extent is the products price associated with sales?”
inference “how much extra will a house be worth if it has a view of the river?”
prediction “is the house under- or over-valued?”


p. 32 how do we estimate f?

parametric and non-parametric
	parametric, reduces the problem of estimating f down to one of estimating a set of parameters
	easier to estimate b0, b1, b2 …bp then it is to fit an entire arbitrary function f
	parametric won’t truly match the unknown form of f
flexible models fit many different possible functional forms for f
	flexible requires estimating greater # of parameters
	this can overfit (too close to noise)

non-parametric, no assumption about form of f made
	needs large data

fitting (linear?) model (ordinary) least squares


p. 35 prediction accuracy and interpretability

why restrictive over flex? easy to interpret
tab high flex overfits
